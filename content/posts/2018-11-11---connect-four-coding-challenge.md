description: My thoughts on developing a Connect Four game using JavaScript
---

I got a coding challenge from an E-commerce company in the bay area. This was for a Frontend developer position. The challenge was simply to develop a connect four game using only HTML, CSS and Javascript. This is the most common board game.

It is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves. [Source Wikipedia]

The interesting part was to develop this game within 4 hours from scratch. I had to code the game in HackerEarth IDE which does not allow copying of content. It would be much faster if I could code in my IDE and then copy it to HackerEarth IDE. I took less than 3 hours to complete the game and it came out good.

You can check this git repo for my code. This is a better version than the one I coded for the challenge.<br>
